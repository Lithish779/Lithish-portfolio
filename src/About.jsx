          My name is Lithish, and I am a Full Stack Developer focused on building fast,
          usable, and SEO-friendly web applications. My strength is creating smooth UIs
          with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and modern component design.
        </p>

        <p className="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-4xl text-lg leading-relaxed text-white/70">
          Alongside frontend expertise, I also work on backend development using Node.js,
          Express, and MongoDB. I can manage projects end-to-end — from UI development to
          scalable API integration.
